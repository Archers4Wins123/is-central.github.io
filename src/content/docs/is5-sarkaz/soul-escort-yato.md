title: Soul Escort Yato Guide
description: A comprehensive guide to the Soul Escort Yato strategy post IS5 DLC2, covering the fundamentals and advanced strategy.
---


## Introduction
Soul Escort (with Kirin R Yato start) is easily one of the most consistent strategies in the IS5 Post-Expansion II metagame, owing to its strong baseline performance against stages that other squads tend to struggle with.
<!-- Expand the hook -->
The advice in this guide will be geared towards players who play on D18 and attempt to achieve Endings 2,4 & 5 in the same run (i.e. 245 runs).

## Drafting

### Hope Management and You
A key difference between Soul Escort and class squads like Sniper/Med or Guard/Vanguard is that Soul Escort has **significantly less** *effective hope* to play with. Specifically, class squads generally begin their run paying 5 hope for a prepomoted E2 6* operator, which represents a savings of 5 hope (the normal cost of recruiting + promoting a 6* operator is `10 = 7 + 3` hope). Furthermore, assuming that class squads recruit and promote a minimum of 4 in-class operators, they gain *at least* an additional 12 `4 * 3` hope over the course of a run. Class squads hence have an all but *guaranteed* surplus of 17 Hope over Soul Escort.

Soul escort is able obtain a significantly higher number of **witchcraft** inspirers, each of which is worth anywhere from `3-5` hope. Furthermore, as class squads generally do not budget all of their theoretically available hope, and as such the hope deficit we must contend with *on average* is not as bad as the numbers suggest.

A reasonable deadline for obtaining all of our key drafts in a run is the end of Floor 5 (including the voucher rewards from the F5 Boss). Our command level at that point can vary significantly depending on when we took the lost&found for end4, but in the majority of runs we should either be Lvl 6 or 7. The total hope we gain from level ups is 

### The Kafka Conundrum
**Kafka** is an extremely powerful option that we have access to. The *ideal* conditions for Kafka are that she is pot 6 (of course) and specifically **Elite 0**. This is because a E0 Kafka costs 2 less DP than a E1 Kafka, and Kafka gains no meaninful benefit from being Elite 1 (the sleep duration of her S1 does not improve with level and her base stats are irrelevant). In addition to Yato and *maybe* the 5* agents, Kafka is arguably the most "pot-gated" operator for Soul Escort. Unlike Yato however, as we don't start the run with Kafka, we have no way to resolve this by way of using a friend support.

As many players may not have the ideal version of Kafka, a common question is whether or not drafting Kafka is "worth it".

Without delving too much into DP logistics, Kafka is best described as an operator that enables **sharp lines of play**. Although Kafka may not represent a meaningful improvement over Gravel (her strongest competitor for a secondary FRD) in many situations, when situations arise in which her stalling capabilities are warranted, there is no substitute for Kafka. 
An example would be taking **Frequent Disputes** with 2 kings and no other 6*s: Yato would normally be overwhelmed by having to deal with 3 lanes worth of enemies, but Kafka would enable us to stall the dublinn phalanxes as well as many of the dreadkaz spawns until we have dealt with the other enemies.
I consider such lines of play sharp as the margin of error tends to be low: you need to correctly identify when to start stalling with Kafka vs letting enemies group up and dealing with them with Yato, as you often won't have sufficient DP to sustain a true "perma stall".

Regarding the "minimum requirement" for Kafka to be a viable draft, I would argue that P4 is the only really significant requirement, as the -2s redeploy time is what enables perma stall strats.

### Simple Draft Guideline

### Auxillary Draft

## Starting Squad
## Floor 1 
As we require either the `+2 Hope` or `Kettle` starting bonuses
## Floor 3

### Antique Appraisal (Cursed Relic Evaluation)
- **Balor'sača's Arrogance ("Ballsack")**
   - Short Term Impact: Mid-High
    - The additional HP and Def and a high propensity to affect Yato breakpoints. However, as it does not affect trash mobs, F3 combat performance is largely unaffected (exception: the F3 boss).
   - Long Term Impact: **Very High**
    - As with other squads, this relic is a disaster to have going into End 4/5. End4 in particular gets substantially harder for us, owing to the Envy issue as well as the fact that the +20% def reduces Yato's S1 damage against Quilon in Map2 by a significant amount.
    <!-- TODO: Calculate the relevant numbers -->

- **Gul'dul's Silence**
   - Short Term Impact: **Very High**
        - Silence is by far the scariest relic to see entering Floor 3, and a big reason why it is recommended to (attempt to) begin wish progress on Floor 2. If you have not yet committed to ending 5, is it strongly advised to delay doing so until you have stabilized wrt King's Progress. Certain F3 stages may no longer be safely taken fractured with this relic (e.g. Bloodlines Debates) as the additional Yato deployments required to simply kill trash mobs with this relic may be too taxing on your DP. Furthermore, the difficulty of all 3 F3 Bosses increases significantly, to the point that you may be required to go for 2 Kings prior to reaching the boss (Silent Guardian in particular gets appreciably harder). 
        - Going into F4, having Silence makes it so that 2 Kings w/ no additional damage is no longer sufficient to open the shop rob, and causes significant problems for stages like (EM) Chaos and Frequent Disputes where we really want to be able to kill certain enemies with a single Yato S3.
    
   - Long Term Impact: Mid
    - Once 3 Kings has been acquired and/or our squad is able to efficiently deal with trash mobs without having to rely on Yato,
    Silence is not too much of a hinderance. The main exception to this is ending 4, where (1) Killing envies with Yato S1 costs additional time, which can be fatal and (2) in a low damage scenario, this relic has a signficiant impact on Greyy's ability to comfortably handle the left lane, and makes drafting additional support more necessary.

- **Qui'sartuštaj's Promise:**
   - Short & Long Term Impact: Mid (Highly variable)
    - In low hope runs, Promise can be a killer as it can significantly affect our hope curve (and therefore our voucher efficiency). In particular, in the absence of hope sources, you should not plan around being able to draft more than 1 6* after seeing Promise. Since Promise itself has no impact on combat ability, you should greed a bit harder for the best possible 6*(s) rather than settling for one that does not *truly* solve e.g. end4. A higher premium should be placed on hope sources when evaluating pathing (Scout) and relic choices.

- **Yliš's Ravings:**
    - Short Term Impact: Low
    - Long Term Impact: Low-Mid
    - None of Yato's skills interact with initial SP. However, the loss of initial SP is significant for Beanstalk/Myrtle, which does affect DP availability to a certain extent. Of course, this issue is resolved once we obtain an agent.
    - The long term impact of Ravings depends on what 6*s you have to picked to complement Yato. However, since many of the commonly picked 6\*s do not care much for initial SP, the overall impact remains low.

- **Shard of the Untold Kings**
    - Short Term Impact: Low
    - Long Term Impact: Low-Mid
    - As is the case with every other squad, the long term impact of this relic is negligible.
    - In the short term, just make sure that Yato isn't the toil bearer!
